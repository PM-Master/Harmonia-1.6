This folder should contain the following files. 
First, however, we need to make sure that all instances of
these files in the PM are identical! If they are not, we need
to modify them so that they be placed here in a central location.
We should have only one instances of each of the following:

* PmGraph.java
* PmGraphModel.java
* PmGraphRenderer.java
* PmNode.java
* ObjectBrowser.java
* UserBrowser.java

If these files are not the same for different components or
applications, we need to modify them so that they are.
