        this build file is a self contained project: it doesn't require anything else 
        that ant 1.6.2 or greater and java 1.4 or greater properly installed.
        
        It is used to install ivy in case you don't already have it.
        
		To install ivy manually run "ant -buildfile install-ivy-build.xml"
